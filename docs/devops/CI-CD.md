# CI/CD

Everything in this file describes what is installed in this repository, not what is
planned. Anything that is deliberately **not** enabled is named as such in
[Not enabled yet](#not-enabled-yet), with the reason.

## What runs, and what it proves

| Workflow | Triggers | Jobs | The claim it backs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ci.yml` | push to any branch, PR into `main`, manual | `unit`, `integration` | The code compiles, the architecture rules hold, the schema builds, the wire contract is the documented one, and the Spring context boots on the properties file that Compose mounts. |
| `database-migrations.yml` | push/PR **that touches a migration, `infra/ci/`, or the workflow itself** | `migrations` | The PostgreSQL server itself refuses what the design says it refuses, an edited migration is caught by checksum, and re-applying a full set changes nothing. |
| `security.yml` | push to any branch, PR into `main`, manual | `dependencies`, `secrets` | The exact resolved dependency set carries no unapproved CRITICAL/HIGH advisory, and no credential exists anywhere in the history or the working tree. |
| `.github/dependabot.yml` | Mondays 06:00 IST, GitHub-side | — | Version and security updates arrive as pull requests, throttled to five open at a time. |

`pull-request.yml` is not a fifth file, and that is a decision rather than an
omission: §1 requires the pipelines to exist *and* says to combine responsibilities
where that improves maintainability. A pull request into `main` is validated by the
same two jobs against the same commit as the branch push, so a separate file would
be a copy. The `pull_request` event is what a reviewer sees as the required checks.

There is no frontend job. `apps/web` does not exist yet, and a job that passes
because it found nothing to check is the false green already closed once in
Failsafe. The frontend job — lockfile install, ESLint, type-check, unit tests,
production build — lands in the same pull request as the scaffold.

### Where each of §2's quality gates lives

| Gate | Enforcement |
| --- | --- |
| Compilation failure | `unit` job: `mvn -B -ntp test` cannot start without a compile. |
| Test failure | `unit` (100 tests) and `integration` (39 tests), both with `failIfNoTests=true`. |
| Type-check failure | Java: the compiler *is* the type check. TypeScript: arrives with `apps/web`. |
| Migration failure | `integration` migrates a fresh database through the application's own Flyway; `database-migrations` re-applies the same set through the Flyway CLI and asserts the server-side constraints. |
| Unapproved critical vulnerability | `security.yml → dependencies`: a CycloneDX SBOM of the resolved graph, scanned against OSV, gated by `infra/ci/osv-gate.sh` on CRITICAL and HIGH. |
| Production build failure | `mvn -B -ntp verify` in `integration` packages the jar that the api image copies. |

"Never bypass failing checks to complete a merge" is enforced by the merge path
below: a failing run leaves the pull request unmergeable, and `gh pr merge` is
never given `--admin`.

## The cycle, as actually executed

```
git fetch origin main
git switch -c feature/<module> origin/main
…implement, and run the local checks below until they are green…
git commit            # author: shubhamdiyos <shubham@diyosinfotech.com>
git push -u origin feature/<module>
        → Actions runs ci.yml (+ security.yml, + database-migrations.yml if it touched SQL)
gh pr create --base main --head feature/<module>
gh pr checks <n> --watch          # wait for the real verdict, do not assume it
gh pr merge <n> --admin=false --delete-branch   # merge only once every check passes
git fetch origin main:main        # update the non-checked-out local main
git switch main && git pull --ff-only
git rev-parse HEAD && git rev-parse origin/main   # must print the same SHA
        → only now start the next module on a new branch
```

`main` is the default branch. Nothing is ever pushed to it directly: the last two
`git push` calls in this repository's history were both feature branches, and both
reached `main` through a merged pull request. `--ff-only` on the pull is the guard
that a stray local commit on `main` would trip immediately.

## Reproducing every check locally

Same commands, same images, no CI required. From the repository root, with Colima
running (`colima start`) and the Compose database up:

```bash
cp .env.example .env                     # never committed (.env is gitignored)
docker compose up -d postgres

cd services/api
mvn -B -ntp test                         # unit + ArchUnit: no daemon, no database
mvn -B -ntp verify                       # + integration tests against PostgreSQL 16
```

The migration and security jobs are backed by scripts in `infra/ci/`, so they are
runnable rather than only readable:

```bash
export PATH="$PWD/infra/ci/bin:$PATH"
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
export SQL_DIR=services/api/src/main/resources/db/migration
export PG_USER="$POSTGRES_USER" PG_PASSWORD="$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" PG_PORT=5432

psql -d postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE saathi_migration'
flyway "-url=jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/saathi_migration" migrate
flyway "-url=jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/saathi_migration" validate

# SBOM, then the OSV gate that CI blocks on
cd services/api && mvn -B -ntp org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-maven-plugin:2.9.1:makeAggregateBom \
  -DincludeTestScope=true && cd ../..
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" -v "$PWD/services/api/target:/sbom" \
  ghcr.io/google/osv-scanner:v2.0.2 scan source -S /sbom/bom.json \
  --all-packages --format json --output /sbom/osv.json
sh infra/ci/osv-gate.sh services/api/target/osv.json

# Secrets, working tree
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo" ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:v8.21.2 \
  detect --no-git --source=/repo --redact
```

Two honest caveats about running these at home:

* The local `--no-git` secret scan reads `.env`, because `.env` is real and it is
  in the directory. In CI the workspace is a checkout, so the same command sees
  only tracked files. A local hit on `.env` is correct behaviour, not a bug.
* `psql` and `flyway` here are the repository's wrappers, and they shell out to
  `docker run`. They expect a server reachable on `127.0.0.1:5432` — the port
  Compose publishes.

## Cost policy, and what a run actually costs

The mandate is zero unexpected spending, so the numbers are stated before the run,
then measured, then left in the file even when the estimate was wrong.

Runner policy: **`ubuntu-latest` only**, in every workflow, in every job. No
larger-runner family, no macOS, no Windows — those bill at multiples of the Linux
rate. GitHub Free gives a private repository **2,000 Linux minutes a month**,
**500 MB** of artifact + package storage, and a **separate 10 GB** of cache storage
per repository. The default spending limit is $0, which means the allowance is a
hard stop rather than a meter — an exceeded quota fails runs, it does not invoice.

| | Estimated before the first run | Measured on the first run (30 Oct 2026, the push that added these workflows) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci.yml`, one branch push | ~8 min (2 min unit + 6 min integration) | **110 s** — `unit` 38 s, `integration` 72 s, cold cache included |
| `security.yml`, one branch push | ~5 min | **51 s** — `dependencies` 44 s, `secrets` 7 s |
| `database-migrations.yml`, one SQL-touching push | ~3 min | **50 s**, and it went red on run 1: the assertion expected the UTC day where the server produced the Indian one. The estimate of its duration was fine; the check was the point. |
| Maven cache | one shared entry, ~250 MB | **one entry, 67.7 MB** (`setup-java-Linux-x64-maven-c5110f…`), written by `unit` and reused by the other two Java jobs. The 10 GB per-repository cache allowance is not in contention. |
| Artifacts per successful run | 0 bytes | **0** — confirmed through the API, not by reading the YAML: `GET /repos/shubhamdiyos/sharthi/actions/runs/41056239592/artifacts` returns `total_count: 0`. Uploads happen only on failure. |

So the honest figure is **~3.5 Linux minutes per push that touches SQL**, ~2 minutes
otherwise — roughly a quarter of what this file estimated before it had run once.
At three pushes a working day that is ~230 minutes a month against the 2,000 free,
and a pull request costs the same as a push only until the concurrency group cancels
the duplicate, which is most of the time.

Two numbers this file deliberately does not claim: total account storage and bandwidth.
Neither is readable through the API available to the repository, both live on the
account's billing page, and the first figure GitHub publishes is a 500 MB pooled
allowance for artifacts plus packages that this pipeline currently uses 0 bytes of.
They belong in the founder's monthly check, listed in
[SECURITY.md → What a reviewer should check monthly](SECURITY.md).

Controls that make those numbers stay small:

* **One run per change, not per event.** `concurrency` is keyed on the branch name
  for both `push` and `pull_request`, so the pull request opened from a push cancels
  the queued duplicate instead of running the same validation twice. Neither event
  was dropped — that would leave a commit unmonitored — the second one is cancelled
  as soon as it starts. `cancel-in-progress` stops billing for an aborted run
  immediately.
* **`timeout-minutes` on every job** (10–20), so a hung build cannot drift toward
  the 360-minute platform default.
* **One Maven cache, shared.** `cache-dependency-path` is scoped to
  `services/api/pom.xml`, so the key is identical in all three jobs that need Java
  and the dependency graph is downloaded once. It also means an unrelated pom change
  elsewhere cannot invalidate a few hundred MB of cached Spring Boot.
* **No Docker build in CI at all.** Nothing here builds an image: GHCR is not
  approved, so an image would be bytes that no environment runs. `verify` packages
  the jar, which is the same artifact the api image later copies.
* **Artifacts only on failure.** `if: failure()` on the only upload step, 7-day
  retention, and the failsafe XML reports only (~30 KB per class).
* **Path filter on the migration job.** Server-side constraint assertions and the
  tamper proof only change when a `.sql` file does; running them on a commit that
  touched no SQL would re-spend free minutes to re-assert yesterday's answer. Migrations
  still apply on *every* push, because `integration` boots the application against a
  freshly migrated database.
* **Pinned tool images and a pinned plugin coordinate** (`osv-scanner:v2.0.2`,
  `gitleaks:v8.21.2`, `cyclonedx-maven-plugin:2.9.1`, `flyway/flyway:12.4.0-alpine`,
  `postgres:16`). A moving tag is a cache-buster and an unreproducible verdict.
* **Dependabot's own throttle.** `open-pull-requests-limit: 5`, weekly, grouped by
  ecosystem — because every PR it opens costs the minutes in the table above.

At the current rate — roughly one module a day, two or three pushes per module,
~13 minutes per push across the three workflows — the monthly projection is in the
low hundreds of the 2,000 free minutes, and nothing in this pipeline can reach a
paid feature without a human changing a setting.

## Not enabled yet

Each of these is a decision the founder has not approved, so none of them is
switched on "so that it is ready". They are listed in the order §13 sets out.

| Step | What it needs | Cost position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 — GHCR images | `release.yml`: build api + web once per `v*` tag, SHA-tag them, scan them with Trivy, attach the SBOM, then push. A retention rule to delete old versions. | GitHub Packages gives 500 MB free, **shared with the artifact allowance above**; container storage beyond that is billed per GB-month. Needs approval, and needs a retention policy decided before the first push. |
| 6 — Staging | A cloud account, a managed Postgres, DNS, TLS. Deployment workflows with a `staging` environment. | Any real cloud resource is paid, and it is the reason the "cloud-portable" parts of the design (12-factor config, one image per service, no host paths, no local sockets) exist. **Nothing is provisioned without explicit approval.** |
| 7 — Production | The same as staging plus a protected environment with a required-approver gate, and OIDC to the cloud provider instead of a stored access key. | Same. OIDC itself is free and is the design's preference precisely so that no long-lived cloud credential ever exists in this repository. |
| 8 — More security tooling | CodeQL and the native gitleaks action, secret scanning push protection, and Dependabot security *updates* on branches other than the default. | CodeQL and gitleaks-action are GitHub Advanced Security features on a private repository: **paid per committer**. The free equivalents already run in `security.yml`, which is why they are not here. |
| 9 — Backup/restore + rollback drills | `docs/devops/DISASTER-RECOVERY.md` and `ROLLBACK.md`, and a rehearsal that restores a `pg_dump` into a scratch container and proves the row counts. | Free: `pg_dump` inside the existing Compose stack, on the laptop. |

`docs/devops/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `ROLLBACK.md` and `DISASTER-RECOVERY.md` arrive with
the steps they document, because a deployment runbook that describes an
environment that does not exist yet is documentation that will be wrong before it
is read. `DOCKER.md` arrives with `apps/web`, whose Dockerfile is the second half
of it.

## Reading a failure

* `unit` red, `integration` green → a kernel rule changed; the ArchUnit message names
  the package and the rule.
* `integration` red on `ApplicationContextIT` → a property in
  `application.yml`/`application-prod.yml` cannot be bound. This job is the only
  place the real configuration is read; the unit suite never starts a context.
* `database-migrations` red on "validate accepted an edited migration" → someone
  amended a shipped `.sql` file. That file must be reverted and replaced by a new
  `V<n>__*.sql`; §8's backward-compatibility rule applies.
* `security.yml → dependencies` red with `BLOCKING` rows → an unapproved CRITICAL/HIGH
  advisory in a resolved dependency. Upgrade through a PR, or, if the advisory does
  not apply, say so in `docs/devops/SECURITY.md` and add a pinned ignore — not in
  the workflow, which is where a silent exception would hide.
* `security.yml → secrets` red with "gitleaks found the canary…" absent → the scan
  itself is broken, which is treated as a failure on purpose. See SECURITY.md.
* A run that is cancelled rather than failed → the same branch pushed again; the
  newer commit is the one that matters.
